## colorscheme

  <p>
    For qBittorrent, I've taken the plunge with the <a href="https://github.com/rebelot/kanagawa.nvim">kanagawa</a> theme, which stands out as an exceptionally refined colorscheme. 
    It's one of the most perfect colorschemes I've come across of late. I was enjoying how pleasant Gruvbox was to the eye and yet wanted something darker. 
    I will be using a darker configuration of it extensively throughout my rice, all of which can be 
    found in the <a href="https://github.com/esskayesss/dots"> <code>dots</code></a> repository. A big shout-out to the creator for making the palette public.
