## colorscheme

  <p>
    For qBittorrent, I've taken the plunge with the <a href="https://github.com/rebelot/kanagawa.nvim">kanagawa</a> theme, which stands out as an exceptionally refined colorscheme. 
    It's one of the most perfect colorschemes I've come across of late. I was enjoying how pleasant Gruvbox was to the eye and yet wanted something darker. 
    I will be using a darker configuration of it extensively throughout my rice, all of which can be 
    found in the <a href="https://github.com/esskayesss/dots"> <code>dots</code></a> repository. A big shout-out to the creator for making the palette public.

## installation

> as a TLDR,
> For any theme on qBittorrent,
> - Get the `*.qbtheme` file. In this case, this is [`kanagawa.qbtheme`](https://github.com/esskayesss/kanagawa-qbtheme/blob/main/kanagawa.qbtheme)
> - In your qBittorrent settings, browse into `Behavior -> Interface` section
> - choose the downloaded file for the `UI Theme file` option after checking the `Use Custom UI Theme` checkbox.
> 
> You can find more themes and yet another guide [here](https://github.com/jagannatharjun/qbt-theme)

1. **Download the theme file:**
   - Download [`kanagawa.qbtheme`](https://github.com/esskayesss/kanagawa-qbtheme/blob/main/kanagawa.qbtheme) by clicking on the `Download raw file` button.
   - Alternatively, you can clone the repository in a folder of your choice to be able to pull for new changes.
2. **Move the file into a theme folder:**
   - Locate the extracted file and move it to a qBittorrent themes directory. This can be anywhere, but for the sake of organization, I use the following paths:
     - For Windows: `C:\Users\YourUsername\qBittorrent\themes`
     - For Linux: `~/.config/qBittorrent/themes`

3. **Select the theme:**
   - Open qBittorrent and go to `Tools -> Options -> Behavior`. <br>
      In case of a Mac, this will be `Preferences -> Behavior`
   - Here, in the interface section, check the `User custom UI Theme` option.
   - Proceed to select the `kanagawa.qbtheme` file from the file explorer for the `UI Theme file:` option.

4. **Restart qBittorrent:**
   - Close and reopen qBittorrent for the changes to take effect.

That's it! Your new theme should now be applied to qBittorrent.
